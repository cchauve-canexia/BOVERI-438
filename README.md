# BOVERI-438: 
Comparison of the strelka results between matching NextSeq and MiSeq runs.

A list of matching NextSeq/MiSeq runs was obtained from RUN_SUMMARIES (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vIIKf5DTvHQy_mG7rCq0oCy-z82kj7bmv88wYcsWWCo/edit#gid=779463918), on December 9, 2020, using https://github.com/contextual-genomics/Bioinformatics/blob/dev/Operations/data_to_exclude/development_runs/v5_miseq/dev_RD_excluded_runs.tsv and https://github.com/contextual-genomics/Bioinformatics/blob/dev/longitudinal_analysis/cohort_details/master_RD_excluded_RUNS.csv to exclude runs. 

Lists of excluded samples were obtained from https://github.com/contextual-genomics/Bioinformatics/blob/dev/Operations/data_to_exclude/development_runs/v5_miseq/dev_RD_failed_samples.tsv and https://github.com/contextual-genomics/Bioinformatics/blob/dev/longitudinal_analysis/cohort_details/master_RD_excluded_samples.csv.
